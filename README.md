# PCOS-Prediction
An ML model that predicts PCOS in women

**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** is a medical condition which causes hormonal disorder in women in their childbearing years. The existing methodologies and treatments are insufficient for early-stage detection and prediction. To deal with this problem, we proposed a system which can help in **early detection and prediction** of PCOS from an optimal and minimal set of parameters. 

The dataset consists of 41 features, and in order to select the dominant 30 features, two methods were employed and compared: **Chi Square test**, **Information Gain**.
The algorithm used is **Random Forest** which is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression.
The mean accuracy and confusion matrix for both the methods were obtained and compared. It was concluded the margin of accuracy difference between the two methods was very minimal.
